## Introduction

[Immutable][] data cannot be changed once created, leading to much simpler
application development, no defensive copying, and enabling advanced memoization
and change detection techniques with simple logic. [Persistent][] data presents
a mutative API which does not update the data in-place, but instead always
yields new updated data.

Immutable.js provides many Persistent Immutable data structures including:
`List`, `Stack`, `Map`, `OrderedMap`, `Set`, `OrderedSet` and `Record`.

These data structures are highly efficient on modern JavaScript VMs by using
structural sharing via [hash maps tries][] and [vector tries][] as popularized
by Clojure and Scala, minimizing the need to copy or cache data.

Immutable.js also provides a lazy `Seq`, all
